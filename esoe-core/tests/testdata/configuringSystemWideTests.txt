# KERBEROS configuration - windows clients (from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/jgss/tutorials/Troubleshooting.html) 
 Cause 2: This exception is thrown when using native ticket cache on some Windows platforms. Microsoft has added a new feature in which they no longer export the session keys for Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGTs). As a result, the native TGT obtained on Windows has an "empty" session key and null EType. The effected platforms include: Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 (SP4) and Windows XP SP2.

Solution 2: You need to update the Windows registry to disable this new feature. The registry key allowtgtsessionkey should be added--and set correctly--to allow session keys to be sent in the Kerberos Ticket-Granting Ticket.

On the Windows Server 2003 and Windows 2000 SP4, here is the required registry setting:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Parameters
    Value Name: allowtgtsessionkey
    Value Type: REG_DWORD
    Value: 0x01  ( default is 0 )

By default, the value is 0; setting it to "0x01" allows a session key to be included in the TGT.

Here is the location of the registry setting on Windows XP SP2:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\
    Value Name: allowtgtsessionkey
    Value Type: REG_DWORD
    Value: 0x01
