---INCREASED LOG OUTPUT FROM SAML2lib-j for cryptography problems---
If you are running your application from the java command line, you need to configure the logging facility so that the XML DSig logging messages are emitted. You can do this by creating a logging.properties file and set it with the java.util.logging.config.file property

java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties

where logging.properties is a properties document with:

handlers= java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
.level= INFO
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = FINER
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
org.jcp.xml.dsig.internal.level = FINER 
com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.security.level = FINER

This will emit XML DSig log messages of level FINER and higher to the console, don't use this in production
