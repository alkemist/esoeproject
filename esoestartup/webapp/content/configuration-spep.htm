The Java SPEP is configured almost entirely by its main config file called spep.config. This is located at:<br/>
<tt>${spep.data}/config/spep.config</tt>

This file requires an indepth understanding of what each option is before you make changes, please <a href="https://esoeproject.org/confluence/eu">consult our online documentation</a> for details on configuration options.

Finally this process has saved a keystore called <strong>spepKeystore.ks</strong> to ${esoe.data}/config ensure it is kept safe and backed up, the spep can't operate without it.
