<h2> Directory Setup </h2>
To operate ESOE, ESOE Manager and SPEP the system needs to have access to directories to store configuration and dynamic content generated at run time. The installation documentation advises you to set the Java properties of <strong>esoe.data</strong>,
<strong>esoemanager.data</strong> and <strong>spep.data</strong> before starting tomcat. These values are reflected below. Should they not be populated yet you can enter them below and before starting Enterprise Sign On Engine you <strong>must</strong>
set these as Java properties.
