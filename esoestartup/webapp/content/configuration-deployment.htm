<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>This section deals with deploying the various components you have now successfully created.</p>

<p>All information below assumes you have undertaken all prerequisite stages at <a href="http://esoeproject.org/confluence/display/eu/ESOE+Installation+Guide">http://esoeproject.org/confluence/display/eu/ESOE+Installation+Guide</a></p>

<p>This tool has created configuration and keystores for you and deployed them to your nominated content directories identifed by the java properties <strong>esoe.data manager.data and spep.data</strong>.
<br/><br/>
The ESOE Startup binary you downloaded contains several other WAR files apart from esoestartup.war these should now be deployed in Tomcat in the following order: 
<br/><br/>
Copy esoemanager.war to $TOMCAT/webapps, wait for approximately a minute. N.B If your running ESOE Manager across multiple nodes you'll need to deploy this war on each node along with a full copy of the content stored at <strong>manager.data</strong>
<br/><br/>
Copy ROOT.war to $TOMCAT/webapps, this will invoke heavy processing load, wait for approximately two minutes.
<br/><br/>
Copy web.war to $TOMCAT/webapps wait for approximately two minutes.
<br/><br/>
Copy spep.war to $TOMCAT/webapps, wait for approximately 1 minute. N.B If your running ESOE Manager across multiple nodes you'll need to deploy this war on each node along with a full copy of the content stored at <strong>spep.data</strong>
<br/><br/>
After another minute or so depending on machine performance you should be able to navigate to http(s)://{HOSTNAME}[:PORT]/esoemanager/manager/, this will invoke the ESOE's SAML 2 SSO engine and you will be redirected to authenticate 
using the default forms based authentication against the LDAP server you provided. You will then be directed back to the manager application and all is now ready for more services to be setup.
<br/><br/>
You should probably look at the ESOE Managers LXACML policy at this stage and start locking it down, more details are available at <a href="http://esoeproject.org/confluence/display/eu/ESOE+Administrators+Guide">http://esoeproject.org/confluence/display/eu/ESOE+Administrators+Guide</a>.

That concludes the installation process, we'd love to hear your feedback on this process in our online community.
