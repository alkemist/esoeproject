<h3> ESOE Manager Configuration </h3>

This section details configuration of the ESOE manager. This is the administration compoment for managing the ESOE authentication network. The ESOE Manager has been automatically configured for you, you should be able to proceed past this point without further changes.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Warning:</strong> While the ESOE Manager makes a disk copy of every metadata update for manual inspection it <strong>DOES NOT</strong> clean these up.
System administrators are advised to use whatever means the deployment system has to remove these, excess files can be deleted at any time. Examples of solutions here may include a 5 hourly cron job on unix hosts to gzip current remove older updates.

The ESOE Manager is configured almost entirely by its main config file called esoemanager.config. This is located at:<br/>
<tt>${esoemanager.data}/config/esoemanager.config</tt>
<br/><br/>
This file requires an indepth understanding of what each option is before you make changes, please <a href="https://esoeproject.org/confluence/eu">consult our online documentation</a> for details on configuration options. 
<br/>
<br/>
Finally this process has saved a keystore called <strong>metadataKeystore.ks</strong> to ${esoemanager.data}/config ensure it is kept safe and backed up, your manager can't operate without it.
