ESOE SAML2 CPP v0.3
-------------------

MSVC++ Win32 build addition:

If using XSD 2.3.1, please apply the w32/xsd-2.3.1-msvc-dllexport.patch to 
the XSD tree before attempting to build this library. It fixes a problem
that prevents compilation due to a bug in Microsoft's implementation of the
C++ standard.
